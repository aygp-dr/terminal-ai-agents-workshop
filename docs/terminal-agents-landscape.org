* The Rise of Terminal AI Agents

#+begin_quote
"Our big bet is that there's a future in which 95% of LLM-computer interaction is through a terminal-like interface."
--- Mike Merrill, Co-creator of Terminal-Bench (Stanford)
#+end_quote

In 2025, AI coding tools shifted to a surprising place: *the terminal*. Since February 2025, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI have all released command-line coding tools, and they're already among the companies' most popular products.

CLI coding agents now "fill a sweet spot" between heavy IDE copilots and web-based generators by being *lighter, faster*, and plugging directly into familiar workflows.

** Industry Adoption

- *53%* of companies experimenting with LLMs for development have deployed to production (a16z Enterprise AI Report 2024)
- *75%* of enterprise software engineers will use AI assistants by 2028, up from <10% in 2023 (Gartner 2025)
- Terminal agents are the *fastest-growing category* of AI developer tools
